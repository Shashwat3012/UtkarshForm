```

\
Backend Setup: \
Open up the project in your IDE and locate the `UtkarshFormApplication.java` file in the `src/main/java/com/shashwat/utkarshForm` folder.

Let’s build and run the program. Open a command line (or terminal) and navigate to the folder where you have the project files. We can build and run the application by issuing the following command:

```bash
.\gradlew.bat bootRun
```

or

Simply locate the `UtkarshFormApplication.java` file and run it in your IDE.

The Spring gets started on running the above command. Spring Boot’s embedded Apache Tomcat server is acting as a webserver and is listening for requests on `localhost port 8080`.
